# NBA_API

The NBA offers a treasure trove of data! From detailed players career stats to individual game performances, team records, and even live game outcomes. This project dig into that wealth of information to explore, visualize, and model various aspects of the game.

It’s a great playground for data science tp:

🧠 Test predictive models on outcomes like win/loss (binary), point spreads (regression), and more

📊 Visualize complex, multidimensional data through creative and informative plots

🕰️ Leverage historical data to validate models across different seasons and matchups

The richness and structure of NBA data make it a compelling case study for both statistical analysis and machine learning.

This is an ongoing project exploring NBA data using the NBA API. While the repo is public, it's primarily a working space where I back up my code, test ideas, and brainstorm. Some parts may be rough around the edges or under development :)

Feel free to explore
and of course, feedback and collaboration ideas are always welcome!
